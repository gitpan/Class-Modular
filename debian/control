Description:  Class::Modular -- Modular class generation superclass
 Class::Modular is a superclass for generating modular classes, where
 methods can be added into the class from the perspective of the
 object, rather than the perspective of the class.
 .
 That is, you can create a class which has a set of generic common
 functions. Less generic functions can be included or overridden
 without modifying the base classes. This allows for code to be more
 modular, and reduces code duplication.
 .
 It fills the middle ground between traditional class based OOP and
 classless OOP. Class::Mutator and Sex are similar to
 Class::Modular but less manic.
