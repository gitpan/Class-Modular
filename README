Class::Modular is a superclass for generating modular classes, where
methods can be added into the class from the perspective of the
object, rather than from the perspective of the class.

See perldoc Class::Modular for more information, and COPYING for
copyright and licensing information.

Current development versions are available at
http://rzlab.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/?root=Class+Modular

Da::DB makes extensive use of Class::Modular, and is available at
http://rzlab.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?root=Da+DB and should be
comming soon to a CPAN mirror near you.
